## 6. "Downfall" Vulnerability (CVE-2022-40982)

**Description:** Also known as Gather Data Sampling (GDS), this vulnerability affects Intel x86-64 microprocessors from the 6th through 11th generations. It is a transient execution CPU vulnerability that can reveal the content of vector registers.  
**Impact:** Potential exposure of sensitive data processed by the CPU.  
**Mitigation:** Apply microcode updates provided by Intel and implement software patches to mitigate this vulnerability.

---

## 7. Retbleed Attack

**Description:** Retbleed is a speculative execution attack on x86-64 and ARM processors, including some recent Intel and AMD chips. It is a variant of the Spectre vulnerability that exploits return instructions.  
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information through speculative execution.  
**Mitigation:** Update system firmware and apply software patches that address speculative execution vulnerabilities.

---

## 8. Operation Triangulation

**Description:** In June 2023, a sophisticated attack named Operation Triangulation targeted iOS devices using previously unknown malware. The attack exploited vulnerabilities in the iOS kernel and WebKit browser engine to silently infect devices.  
**Impact:** Unauthorized surveillance and data extraction from compromised iOS devices.  
**Mitigation:** Update to the latest iOS versions that include patches for the exploited vulnerabilities.
