CVE-2024-23496 in llama.cpp and Other Popular/Dangerous Vulnerabilities
First, let's clarify the specific CVE you mentioned: CVE-2024-23496. 
This is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the GGUF library's gguf_fread_str function within the llama.cpp project (commit 18c2e17). 
It affects the parsing of metadata strings in GGUF files (used for AI models like those in llama.cpp). 
By crafting a malicious GGUF file with an oversized string length (e.g., UINT64_MAX, causing allocation wraparound to 0 bytes), 
an attacker can trigger a buffer overflow during fread, leading to potential crashes,
memory corruption, or remote code execution (RCE) if chained with other exploits.
The vulnerability is rated CVSS 9.8 (Critical) and was patched in later commits (e.g., b5662).
It's particularly dangerous for AI/ML environments using llama.cpp for local inference, 
as attackers could exploit it via malicious model files. No active in-the-wild exploitation has been widely reported, 
but PoCs exist, making it a supply-chain risk for developers and users of AI tools.

Based on your query, I'll provide a list of popular and dangerous CVEs. 
Since "all type" is broad (there are over 200,000 CVEs), I've focused on the most popular 
and dangerous ones from recent years (2024 and all-time), selected based on factors like CVSS score (7.0+ for high/critical),
exploitation in the wild (e.g., from CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog), impact (e.g., RCE, data breaches), 
and prevalence (e.g., affecting millions of systems). I've categorized them into:

Recent (2024): Top exploited or emerging threats.
All-Time Classics: Historical CVEs that remain highly dangerous due to widespread unpatched systems and ongoing exploitation.

The list is not exhaustive but prioritizes those with real-world impact (e.g., ransomware, nation-state attacks).
Descriptions include severity, affected software, exploitation details, and mitigation. Sources are cited inline for substantiation.
Recent Popular and Dangerous CVEs (2024 Focus)
These are drawn from CISA's KEV Catalog, Qualys reports, and active exploitation trends in 2024. 
They often involve RCE in enterprise tools, affecting VPNs, AI frameworks, and cloud services. 
Exploitation time averages 5 days post-disclosure, leading to mass breaches.

Key Insights and Recommendations

Trends: In 2024, AI/ML tools (e.g., llama.cpp, Ollama) emerged as high-risk due to supply-chain attacks, with RCE via malicious models. All-time CVEs like Log4Shell show legacy flaws persist, exploited in ransomware (e.g., WannaCry affected 200k+ systems). Over 40,000 CVEs were published in 2024 (38% increase from 2023), but only ~1% are weaponized—focus on CISA KEV for prioritization.
Why Dangerous: High CVSS scores indicate easy exploitation (remote, no auth). Impacts include RCE (system takeover), data theft, and lateral movement in networks.
Mitigation Best Practices:

Patch Immediately: Use tools like Qualys VMDR for scanning; prioritize KEV CVEs (e.g., average exploit time: 5 days).
Supply-Chain Security: Validate AI models (e.g., checksums for GGUF files); audit dependencies.
Network Controls: Disable unused services (e.g., RDP, VPN blades); use WAF/EDR.
Monitoring: Implement anomaly detection; follow CISA BOD 22-01 for cloud patching.
Zero-Trust: Enforce MFA, least privilege, and regular audits.



For full details, consult NVD or CISA KEV. If a specific CVE affects your systems, scan immediately—unpatched flaws like these have caused breaches costing millions.
